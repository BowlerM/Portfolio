            <p>I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student studying for a MEng at The University of Leeds. I'm passionate
                about software development with most experience in web development
                but always eager to expand my skills into other areas of software engineering.

            <p>I'm currently seeking a placement year for inbetween my 3rd and 4th year of university but also open
                to a summer internship.
